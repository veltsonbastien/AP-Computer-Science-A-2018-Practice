# AP-Computer-Science-A-2018-Practice
My answers for the 2018, AP Computer Science A test, FRQ portion. 

If you came from my YouTube channel, thanks for watching and I hope that the videos helped. 

I did my best to check each answer based on the examples given in the AP Computer Science A FRQ. If there is a mistake, please let me know by reaching out to me at bastienveltson@outlook.com 

Usage Tips: 
I made everything using BlueJ, so if you're new to navigating through files as such, when you open a folder, look for files that end in the ".java" extension, so you can see the code. 

If you want to copy and paste the Word Pair tester code, be sure to configure the classes separately and properly. Everything else, you should be able to just copy right in. 

Good luck, and to a 0b1001 on the test, I wish everyone the best.
